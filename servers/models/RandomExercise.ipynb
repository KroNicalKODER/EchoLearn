       "\"**Reading Exercise**\\n\\nElon Musk: A Visionary's Journey\\n\\nElon Musk is a name synonymous with innovation and disruption in the modern era. Born in South Africa, Musk's entrepreneurial spirit was evident from an early age. After moving to Canada and eventually the United States, he co-founded his first company, Zip2, which provided online content publishing software for news organizations.\\n\\nMusk's next venture, X.com, would later become PayPal, which was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion. However, it was SpaceX that catapulted Musk into the stratosphere of innovation, with its reusable rockets and ambitious plans to colonize Mars.\\n\\nTesla, Inc., another company co-founded by Musk, has revolutionized the electric vehicle market, making sustainable energy accessible to a wider audience. Through his vision and perseverance, Elon Musk has become a polarizing figure, with supporters lauding his innovative spirit and critics questioning his leadership and ethics.
